Step 1: Clone the repository and enter into the directory.
Step 2: Create a virtual environment using `pipenv` (Installation: pip install pipenv) and grab a shell using `pipenv shell`.
Step 3: Install the required packages using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Step 4: To check out the API, the `app.py` file needs to be run using `python app.py` or `python3 app.py`, depending on your Python version. The link in the terminal is to be opened and the available routes are to be checked before running them.
Step 5: If you are interested to run the tests as well, you can run `pytest test.py` in the terminal.
